# Radio_Room

## About:
Radio_Room is an interactive World War 2 text-based web game demo. Help  Private Ben get through the battlefield to safety. Choose between two responses for every section of dialogue he sends to you through the radio, which is displayed on the screen. The weather is displayed in the upper left corner for context of what Private Ben’s situation is like… wherever he is. Because the game is a demo there are only two rooms. There are also no save options, but you can look at your progress by pressing the “progress button” which navigates to a .txt file. Refresh the page to play again and try something different! 

### Features:
* Create 3 or more unit tests for your application. Isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. This includes the output to the .txt file, retrieval of data from the database, retrieval of data from the API, and the input and output to the webpage.

* Add comments to your code explaining how you are using at least 2 of the SOLID principles. Through the use of SOLID, make sure the code is extended in a sustainable, manageable and efficient way.

* Write information/data to a text file. The player’s choices will be logged and written to a text file for the player to review and be able to try something different next time they play.
