# Radio_Room

Main idea:
Create a console game that asks questions like D'n D, playing a certain choice displayed per question.

Does the radio room refer to the room in which you the player are? and you're communicating with the character you created? so the character asks you questions on his path on the adventure and you give guidance
(in that case maybe there should be a second character name to enter)

Features (ideas):

* Multinarrative (first make a single narrative, then build on it)
* It could use different letters and symbols to create pictures for the visual side
* creating your own user with a name (which is used repeatedly when there are conversations)
* creating your own character with 6 different character type options (robot, soldier, alien, celestial, Medic, sentinel - should have multiple strengths and weaknesses per character type - maybe have different versions of each character type eventually)
* a health and damage count for your chosen character type's equipment, as well as any other features (look at a character design sheet for ref)
* a story path, different kinds of obsticles with their own health or damage count

Need to figure out:

* How could this be used as an API
* the simplest version of this I could create (no character types, single narrative, up to 6 big obstacles in which there are 6 smaller obstacles, maybe just one level at first then build on it)
