Tasks:

1. Carve out weather razorhtml into a razor component, with all the code - 
referenced in the razor.html as weathercomponent

2. automatic save (on the backend) - Store past dialogue options, tell blazor to iterate over 
past dialogue options and render it 

define a dialogueset as a class - put this in the database as another table with 
only three columns:
(each with more numbers pointing to the other table) 2 foreign keys, a primary key, dialogue set

public Dictionary<int, response>; define styles in this class 

figure out linkage from one dialogueset to the next, depending on which option the player chooses

3. get rid of the repetitious code tied to dialogue html, and fix it

4. populate dictionary from dialogueset database table to connect appropiate responses to, with ints 
(dictionary components are what are logged in to the automatic save)

5. if the outcome saved is null then game over with a while loop, after while loop 
"thanks for playing" 

6. Make sure the code to database is modular and the database will automatically update itself

7. store all data in lists, use a parser and if else loop to find line breaks, 
make it look nice through code and push that into the mudtext
